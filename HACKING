gzochi Hacking Notes

Bootstrapping ==================================================================

When gzochi is obtained from Git, a few extra steps must be taken before the
usual configure, make, make install cycle can be executed. First, ensure that
you have installed recent versions of the tools listed below:

* Autoconf (http://www.gnu.org/s/autoconf/)
* Automake (http://www.gnu.org/s/automake/)
* Libtool (http://www.gnu.org/s/libtool/)

Then run the autogen.sh script located at the top-level directory of the gzochi
source distribution to generate all the requisite configure and Makefile files.
There is an autogen.sh script for each component of the gzochi framework; the
top-level autogen.sh script will invoke all of them in the proper order.
