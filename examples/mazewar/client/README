Please send bug reports to gzochi-devel@nongnu.org.

Additional INSTALL instructions ============================================

Generic instructions for configuring and compiling the mazewar client can be 
found in the INSTALL file. More specific information and configure options
can be found below.

The gzochi mazewar example client depends on the following external libraries.
- libg
- libgzochi
- libSDL

You can use the `--with-SDL-prefix' option when invoking ./configure, if you
have libSDL installed to a location other than the standard place (/usr or
/usr/local).

The dependencies on libg and libgzochi are configured using `pkg-config'.


Required External Packages =================================================

The mazewar client requires the following external packages:

  - GNU GLib, at least version 2.28

    GLib is used in several places in the client for its general-purpose 
    utility functions and data structures. It is available from 
    http://www.gtk.org/ .

  - Simple DirectMedia Layer (libSDL), at least version 1.2.14

    SDL is used for managing the client's display and for accepting input from
    the user. It is available from http://www.libsdl.org/ .

  - pkg-config

    The client's ./configure script uses pkg-config to discover the correct 
    compile and link options for a number of the libraries above.
