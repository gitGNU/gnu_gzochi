Changes in 0.8 (since 0.7)

* Notable changes

** Switch to asynchronous reference client implementation

The gzochi mazewar client now depends on the libgzochi-glib reference client 
library instead of libgzochi (which has been removed from the distribution). The
resulting client application is now single-threaded. Commentary in the example
source code has been updated to explain main loop-based execution.

* Compatibility

** Support for additional platforms

As a result of the change described above, gzochi mazewar now builds and runs
properly for the first time on Mac OS X.
