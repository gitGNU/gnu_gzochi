gzochi mazewar is a clone of the classic MazeWar game developed at NASA and MIT
in the mid-1970s. MazeWar was one of the first games --- possibly the first 
game --- to feature multiplayer interaction over a network. With the aid of a 
first-person 3-D perspective view and an overhead map, players chase each other
through a maze and shoot each other with missiles to earn points.

This implementation differs somewhat from the original MazeWar variants: 
Whereas the first versions of MazeWar passed network messages across a
peer-to-distinguished-peer host topology, gzochi mazewar operates in a strict
client-server fashion. Some variants of MazeWar include the ability to peek
around corners or enter an "omniscient" mode where all players become visible
regardless of position. gzochi mazewar is distinctly no-frills in this respect,
and only allows players to turn to the left or right, step forward, and shoot
missiles. Users are encouraged to modify this software to add any desired
features that may be missing!

The source code for the both the server and client components of gzochi mazewar
has been heavily annotated to help explicate the workings of the game logic and
the interactions between the client and server. It is hoped that the code 
comments and other documentation will be useful for developers attempting to 
write their own games for the gzochi framework. Please send any questions or 
comments to the gzochi development mailing list: gzochi-devel@nongnu.org.
