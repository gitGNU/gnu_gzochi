The Land Of Four Winds is a multi-player interactive adventure game.

You control your presence in The Land Of The Four Winds by typing commands to 
an English language parser. As with all computer games the commands that the 
computer understands are limited. Basic commands consist of either a verb or a
verb with one or more adjectives and nouns. For instance to get this message
you typed 'help'. Other useful commands include 'look' to review where you are 
currently. To pick up items, use the command 'take'. To drop items use the
command 'drop'. You can review what you are carrying by typing 'inventory'.
You can move around by using typing in directions. The 'exits' command will 
list any obvious exits and where they appear to lead.

This is a multi-player game, and there are therefore commands to talk and to
interact with other players. The first of these you might use is 'say'. E.g.
'say what on earth is going on here ?'.
