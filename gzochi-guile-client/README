This is version 0.10 of (gzochi client), a GNU Guile client library for the
gzochi game development framework.

gzochi is a framework for developing massively multiplayer online games. A
server container provides services to deployed games, which are written in GNU
Guile Scheme, that abstract and simplify some of the most challenging and
error-prone aspects of online game development: Concurrency, data persistence, 
and network communications. A very thin client library can be embedded to 
provide connectivity for client applications written in any language.

(gzochi client) is a reference client library implementation that provides an
API for authentication and communication with a gzochi application endpoint. It
is intended for use in the implementation of gzochi game client applications.

Complete documentation for the reference client API can be found in the source
code for the reference client itself.
