This is version 0.0 of mictlan, the debugging client for the gzochi game
development framework.

gzochi is a framework for developing massively multiplayer online games. A
server container provides services to deployed games, which are written in
Guile Scheme, that abstract and simplify some of the most challenging and
error-prone aspects of online game development: Concurrency, data persistence, 
and network communications. A very thin client library can be embedded to 
provide connectivity for client applications written in any language.

mictlan provides a simple command-line interface for interacting with arbitrary
endpoints in a running gzochid instance using the API provided by the libgzochi
client library.
