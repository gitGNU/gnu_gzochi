This is version 0.7 of the gzochi game development framework.

gzochi is a framework for developing massively multiplayer online games. A
server container provides services to deployed games, which are written in 
Guile Scheme, that abstract and simplify some of the most challenging and
error-prone aspects of online game development: Concurrency, data persistence, 
and network communications. A very thin client library can be embedded to 
provide connectivity for client applications written in any language.

This is the top level of the gzochi distribution. To build and begin developing
with gzochi, visit the following sub-directories, each of which correponds to a
component of the distribution:

* gzochi-common/ - the static utility library shared between the server and 
  client modules
* gzochi-server/ - gzochid, the server for the gzochi framework
* gzochi-glib-client/ - libgzochi-glib, the GLib reference client library 
  implementation
* gzochi-guile-client/ - (gzochi client), the GNU Guile reference client library
  implementation
* examples/ - some example games with client and server component 
  implementations intended to help new developers understand the gzochi
  framework
