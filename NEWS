Changes in 0.6 (since 0.5)

* Compatibility

** Support for additional platforms

gzochi now builds on Mac OS X and (likely) other BSD variants.


Changes in 0.3 (since 0.2)

* Changes to the distribution

** New client support static library: libgzochi-client-common

Some of the trickier aspects of client communication with a gzochi server
instance, such as maintaining a buffer for partial message delivery, have been
factored out of libgzochi and into a static library, with a source distribution
under the "gzochi-client-common/" tree, that can be built into other client 
implementations. 

** New reference client library implementation: libgzochi-glib

libgzochi-client-common already has a consumer in the distribution:
libgzochi-glib, a new reference client implementation that integrates easily 
with the "main loop" functionality in the popular GNU GLib library to support
the development of single-threaded client applications. The source distribution
for libgzochi-glibis under the "gzochi-glib-client/" tree.

** Removed deprecated debugging client

mictlan, the primitive "debugging client" included with earlier versions of the
gzochi framework, has been removed from the distribution. Its functionality has
been superceded by the debugging capabilities of gzochid itself, which can be 
accessed using a telnet client.


Changes in 0.2 (since 0.1)

* Changes to the distribution

** New example: abermud

Client and server code for a new example game -- based on Alan Cox's 
AberMUD -- has been added to the source distribution under the "examples/"
tree. This example demonstrates techniques for maintaining a persistent world
in which state is shared between multiple players.
