This is version 0.11 of libgzochi-glib, the GLib-compatible client library for
the gzochi game development framework.

gzochi is a framework for developing massively multiplayer online games. A
server container provides services to deployed games, which are written in GNU
Guile Scheme, that abstract and simplify some of the most challenging and
error-prone aspects of online game development: Concurrency, data persistence, 
and network communications. A very thin client library can be embedded to 
provide connectivity for client applications written in any language.

libgzochi-glib is a reference client library implementation that provides an 
API for authentication and communication with a gzochi application endpoint,
and integrates easily with the GLib library's "main loop" functionality. It is
intended for use in the implementation of gzochi game client applications.


Additional INSTALL instructions ===============================================

Generic instructions for configuring and compiling libgzochi-glib can be found 
in the INSTALL file. libgzochi-specific information and configuration options 
can be found below.

libgzochi-glib depends on the following external libraries.
- libg
- libgzochi-common

The dependency on libg is configured using `pkg-config'.

libgzochi-common is provided as part of the gzochi distribution and is assumed 
to have been built in a directory adjacent to the directory in which 
libgzochi-glib is being configured and built.


Required External Packages ====================================================

gzochid requires the following external packages:

  - GNU GLib, at least version 2.28

    GLib is used throughout gzochid for its general-purpose utility functions
    and data structures. It is available from http://www.gtk.org/ .

  - pkg-config

    libgzochi-glib's ./configure script uses pkg-config to discover the correct 
    compile and link options for the GLib library above.


Special Instructions For Some Systems =========================================

We would like libgzochi-glib to build on all systems using the simple 
instructions above, but a few systems may need special treatment.  If you can 
send us fixed for system-specific problems, we'd be grateful.

About This Distribution =======================================================

Interesting files include:

- COPYING, which contains the terms of GNU General Public License.

Files are usually installed according to the prefix specified to configure,
/usr/local by default. Building and installing gives you:

Libraries, in ${prefix}/lib. Depending on the platform and options given to
        given to configure, you may get shared libraries in addition to or
        instead of these static libraries.
