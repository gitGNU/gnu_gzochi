Changes in 0.6 (since 0.5):

* Notable changes

** Disconnect handling

The prepare-check-dispatch cycle in libgzochi-glib now properly interprets I/O
error conditions (such as broken pipes) as dispatchable events, and invokes the
registered handler accordingly. One result of this change is that server 
shutdown now properly triggers the client's disconnect handler.


Changes in 0.5 (since 0.4):

* Notable changes

** Disable Nagle's algorithm on client socket connections

Because messages sent by libgzochi-glib to the gzochi server will frequently be
smaller than the MSS/MTU, and because the impact of latency on game
interactions is severe, libgzochi-glib now preemptively disables Nagle's 
algorithm for the connections it creates.

* Bug fixes

** gzochi reference clients should handle SIGPIPE
