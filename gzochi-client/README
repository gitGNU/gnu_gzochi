This is version 0.0 of libgzochi, the client library for the gzochi game
development framework.

gzochi is a framework for developing massively multiplayer online games. A
server container provides services to deployed games, which are written in GNU
Guile Scheme, that abstract and simplify some of the most challenging and
error-prone aspects of online game development: Concurrency, data persistence, 
and network communications. A very thin client library can be embedded to 
provide connectivity for client applications written in any language.

libgzochi is a reference client library implementation that provides an API for
authentication and communication with a gzochi application endpoint. It is
intended for use in the implementation of gzochi game client applications.


Additional INSTALL instructions ===============================================

Generic instructions for configuring and compiling libgzochi can be found in 
the INSTALL file. libgzochi-specific information and configuration options can
be found below.

libgzochi depends on the following external libraries.
- libgzochi-common

libgzochi-common is provided as part of the gzochi distribution and is assumed
to have been built in a directory adjacent to the directory in which libgzochi
is being configured and built.


Special Instructions For Some Systems =========================================

We would like libgzochhi to build on all systems using the simple instructions 
above, but a few systems may need special treatment.  If you can send us fixes
for system-specific problems, we'd be grateful.
