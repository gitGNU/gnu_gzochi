Changes in 0.5 (since 0.4):

* Notable changes

** Disable Nagle's algorithm on client socket connections

Because messages sent by libgzochi to the gzochi server will frequently be
smaller than the MSS/MTU, and because the impact of latency on game
interactions is severe, libgzochi now preemptively disables Nagle's algorithm 
for the connections it creates.

* Bug fixes

** gzochi reference clients should handle SIGPIPE


Changes in 0.4 (since 0.3):

* Bug fixes

** Client should not dispatch more than one message during connect
