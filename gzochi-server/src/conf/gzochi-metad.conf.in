# The name of the storage engine to use to store game application data. Must be
# bdb (for Berkeley DB) or mem (for gzochid's built-in B*tree-based storage
# engine respectively). Support for storage engines (besides 'mem') depends on
# the requisite module (and associated third-party database libraries) being 
# installed.
# 
# If this setting is omitted, the server will fall back to using the 'mem' 
# storage engine, which means that game application data will not be persisted 
# to disk. Note that this is not a safe configuration for a server in a 
# production context!
