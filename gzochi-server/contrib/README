This folder contains various supplemental files useful for operating and
debugging gzochid, the gzochi application server and gzochi-metad, the gzochi
meta server.

Wireshark Lua protocol dissectors =============================================

Wireshark (https://www.wireshark.org/) is a network protocol analyzer and
front-end for libpcap. This folder includes two Lua scripts that integrate with
Wireshark as plugins for its "protocol dissector" framework, which allows a
packet capture that includes traffic from a gzochi server cluster to be rendered
in an interactive, human-readable format. `game-protocol.lua' decodes the
protocol used for communication between client applications and gzochid;
`meta-protocol.lua' decodes the protocol used for communication between gzochid
and gzochi-metad. Use these plugins to trace the conversations the take place
between the components of a gzochi application as gameplay events are processed.

Add the plugins to your `init.lua' file or have Wireshark load them via a
command line argument:

  $ wireshark -X lua_script:game-protocol.lua

Initiate a capture (or open a saved capture file) and then select "Decode As..."
from the "Analyze" menu.
