.TH GZOCHI-MIGRATE 1 "July 27, 2014"
.SH NAME
gzochi-migrate \- Transform the contents of a gzochi database
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gzochi-migrate
[-n] [-q] <migration_descriptor>
.br
.B gzochi-migrate
[-h | -v]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The gzochi-migrate utility executes a schema migration against a gzochi game
database, allowing managed records to be transformed, removed, or created 
outside the scope of a running game application.
.PP
The migration process is driven by the migration descriptor, an XML file whose
path is given by \fBmigration_descriptor\fR. This file specifies the game data 
store to be migrated and provides a reference to a "visitor" procedure that is 
called on every reachable object in the data store. The complete semantics of 
the XML migration descriptor and a description of the migration algorithm are 
described in the "Tools" section of the gzochid reference manual; a brief 
description of the migration process follows:
.PP
An graph of game objects is created and traversed by dereferencing each binding
in the "names" database to an object identifier, executing the migration visitor
procedure on the corresponding object retrieved from the "oids" database, and
enqueuing any references to other objects for subsequent visit in breadth-first
order. When an object is visited, gzochid-migrate takes one of three actions, 
depending on the value returned by the visitor function. If the visitor returns:
.IP \[bu]
\fB#f\fR, the object is removed from the object graph
.IP \[bu]
\fBa managed record\fR, the object is replaced by this value
.IP \[bu]
\fBan unspecified value\fR, the object is left unmodified
.IP \[bu]
\fBany other value\fR, an error is signaled
.PP
Each object that is reachable from a named binding is visited exactly once, no
matter how many other bindings or objects hold references to it.
.PP
Note that because gzochi-migrate modifies the contents of gzochi game databases,
\fBany gzochid processes accessing the target game data should be stopped before
running gzochi-migrate.\fR gzochi-migrate creates transactions that even in 
"dry run" mode (see below) establish read locks on the underlying game data 
store, which can interfere with the performance of a gzochid server processing 
transactions against the same store.
.PP
When all reachable objects have been visited, the migration is complete.
gzochid-migrate prints to standard error the results of the migration, including
the counts of objects visited, modified, and removed.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP \fB\-h,\ \-\-help\fR
Write usage information to standard error, and exit.
.IP \fB\-n,\ \-\-dry\-run\fR
Execute a dry run of the migration, such that any modifications performed by the
migration transformer are rolled back instead of committed to the data store. 
Use this flag to verify that a migration behaves as expected before allowing it
to make permanent changes to data.
.IP \fB\-q,\ \-\-quiet\fR
Suppress the display of log messages and post-migration stats reporting.
.IP \fB\-v,\ \-\-version\fR
Write version information to standard error, and exit.
