# Usage: uninstalled-env [ARGS]

# This script arranges for the environment to support running gzochid and 
# related programs from the build tree. The following env vars may be modified 
# (but not clobbered): GZOCHID_CONF_LOCATION and GZOCHID_STORAGE_ENGINE_DIR.

# Example: ./uninstalled-env ../src/gzochid

if test -z "$GZOCHID_CONF_LOCATION"; then
    export GZOCHID_CONF_LOCATION="@abs_top_builddir@/meta/conf/gzochid.conf"
fi

if test -z "$GZOCHID_STORAGE_ENGINE_DIR"; then
    export GZOCHID_STORAGE_ENGINE_DIR="@abs_top_builddir@/src/storage"
